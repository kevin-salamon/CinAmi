## Features

#### CinAmi allows users to view an ever-changing database of user-submitted movies, afterwhich they can learn about, rate, and review those movies.
- JSON Web Tokens and BcryptJS work together to authenticate users and then keep their information hidden from others.
- Easy-to-use UI makes for a streamlined user experience - it is very simple to add movies, comments, and ratings, and to filter through all available submitted movies.

## Usage
- To begin, users are encouraged to create an account by "signing-up" in the top-righthand corner, or to log-in if an account has already been created. Without an account, users will not be able to contribute movies, comments, or ratings.
- Viewing existing movies is simple - all available movies will appear towards the bottom of the screen. A search bar above these movies allows users to filter the movies based on title. 
- Should a user want to create a movie, they simple have to click the large "add movie" button on the top navbar, and submit a title, description, and picture URL. Only administrators can delete movies from the database (by clicking the 'X' button within each movie block).
- To view comments and add comments/ratings, simply click on the 'reviews' button within each movie block. A submission of a full review is one comment and one rating. Each user may only review each movie one time.
